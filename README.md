# Playlist Sync Tool ðŸš€

The Playlist Sync Tool is a Python application designed to synchronize songs between Spotify and YouTube playlists. It offers functionalities to extract playlist IDs, authenticate with Spotify and YouTube APIs, add songs from Spotify to a YouTube playlist, and remove duplicate entries from the YouTube playlist.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip for installing Python packages

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following contents:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='your_spotify_client_id'
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_spotify_client_secret'
   YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRETS='path_to_your_youtube_client_secrets.json'
   ```
   Replace `'your_spotify_client_id'`, `'your_spotify_client_secret'`, and `'path_to_your_youtube_client_secrets.json'` with your actual credentials.

## API Setup
